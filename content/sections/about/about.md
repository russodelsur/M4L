Our founders started MADE4LIVING out of deep frustration. Coming from the design and real estate worlds, they were amazed by the lack of solutions to make designs and property searches simply and accessible. Who is ready to pay 40% extra costs for unexpected house upgrades? 

In the Amazon age, who can wait months before finding the right property or the right professionals? That gave them drive to build a design and property solutions company suited for the 21st century, offering all-in service from bespoke house searches to design the place of your dreams.
